## Why I Built This

I got tired of jumping between different social media platforms to check analytics. Every platform has different metrics and interfaces, and I wanted something simple that showed everything I cared about in one place.

This also serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating:
- Dashboard design and layout
- Data visualization with charts
- Clean, modern UI
- Responsive design

The data is currently hardcoded since this is a demo, but it could easily be connected to real social media APIs.

## Future Improvements

- PDF export for reports
- More detailed time-based breakdowns
- Month-over-month comparisons
- Trend predictions
